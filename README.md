# wine-quality-dataset-implementation-in-TF-2.0
Built different regression neural network models to analyze the impact of different additional layers on the result i.e the 'mse' loss and 'mae' error metrics.

I have built different models to analyse the effects of different models or paramteres in the result (regression). Then i did some optimzation to analyze the results of different models and also plotted the graph of "mse vs epochs" and "mae vs epochs"

Then I have portrayed methods to reduce over-fitting of the model.
BY regularzing the weights of the model.
and By changing the optimizer and tuning it's parameters.
